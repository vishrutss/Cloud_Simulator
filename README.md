# Cloud Simulator
A project that simulates a cloud environment locally for beginners to learn cloud concepts.

# Planned Features:
* Virtual Servers (VMs): Simulate virtual machines that allow users to deploy and manage applications.
* Networking Simulation: Provide virtual private networks (VPNs) and firewalls for secure communication between VMs.
* Object Storage: Mimic services like AWS S3 for file storage and access.
* Containerization: Integrate Docker to teach container deployment.
* Monitoring and Scaling: Simulate auto-scaling based on mock resource metrics.

# Technologies:
* Python: For the backend logic.
* Docker: For simulating containers and services.
* VirtualBox/VMWare: For running VMs locally.
* Flask/Django: For building the interface.
* SQLite: To manage data on VMs, networking, etc.
